  Project plan

 >>Progress so far
  : Board is created as a class, its a hash with the keys as the row no:, each containing an array of the columns
  : Pieces are created as separate classes, each piece knows its own position at definition






 >> User inputs:-
  A system of selecting a square with a piece to move and selecting a destination to be moved into will used for convenience.
  Therefore, all user inputs will be 2 characters long ex: (h5)
  This will make it considerably easier to implement a graphical user interface later on.

  >>Universal format for a square
   [ [column], [row]]

   Both column and row will be represented by integers, where in column,

   a => 1
   b => 2
   c => 3
   d => 4
   e => 5
   f => 6
   g => 7
   h => 8

  >>Universal format for a move
  [colour, square]

  To be defined :=






implement a system for movement of pieces
